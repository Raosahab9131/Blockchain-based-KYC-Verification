# Blockchain-based-KYC-Verification
# Project Title
Blockchain-based KYC Verification

## Project Description
This smart contract allows users to submit a hashed version of their KYC documentation. An admin can then verify or reject the submission, and the status is recorded immutably on the blockchain. This reduces paperwork, increases transparency, and ensures that identity records are verifiable and tamper-proof.

## Project Vision
To decentralize the Know Your Customer (KYC) process by moving verification status on-chain, giving users and service providers a reliable, verifiable record that reduces repeated checks and increases trust across platforms.

## Future Scope
- Enable multiple KYC levels and documents per user
- Add decentralized validator support (via DAO or staking)
- Integrate zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving KYC
- Allow selective disclosure of KYC elements
